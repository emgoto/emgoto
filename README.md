### Hello world!

Welcome to my Github profile. You can also find me on the web at my blog ðŸ“– [emgoto.com](https://www.emgoto.com).

I originally started it as a programming blog, but am in the process of re-purposing it into a hiking blog :) 

#### Notable repositories
The code for my programming blog is open source and is available to check out [here](https://github.com/emgoto/emgoto.com).

I've also created three Trello Power-Ups. They're installed on over ~50,000 Trello boards and the code are available to peruse (at your own risk!) I no longer maintain them so feel free to re-use the code for your own purposes.
